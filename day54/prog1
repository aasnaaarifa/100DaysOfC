//Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main() {
    long long n;
    printf("Enter n: ");
    if (scanf("%lld", &n) != 1) return 0;
    long long t = n * (n + 1) / 2;         
    long long s = (long long) floor(sqrt((double)t));
    if (s * s == t && s >= 1 && s <= n) {
        printf("Answer: %lld", s);
    } else {
        printf("Answer: -1");
    }
    return 0;
}
