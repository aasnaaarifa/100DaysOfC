//Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter array size: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n];
    printf("Enter array: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }
    int x;
    printf("Enter the value of x: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(low <= high){
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if(arr[mid] >= x){
            ans = mid;      
            high = mid - 1; 
        }
        else{
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    printf("Answer: %d", ans);
    return 0;
}
