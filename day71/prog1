//Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char name[100];
    int age;
    FILE *file;
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);  
    int len = 0;
    while(name[len] != '\0') len++;
    if(len > 0 && name[len - 1] == '\n') name[len - 1] = '\0';
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    file = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if(file == NULL){
        printf("Error creating file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    fprintf(file, "Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age);
    fclose(file);
    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");
    return 0;
